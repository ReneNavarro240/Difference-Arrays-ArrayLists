# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

Main Post

In Java, an array is a fixed size structure used to store multiple values of the same type under one variable name. When an array is created, its length is set and cannot change. Elements are accessed using an index starting at 0. Arrays are useful when the number of elements is known in advance and when you want fast, direct access to any position. 

An ArrayLists is a class from to the Java library that represents a list of elements that can grow or shrinks as the program runs. Instead of using a fixed length, and ArrayList provides methods such as add, rmove, get, and size to manage the collection. ArrayLists store objects, so when working with numbers you use wrapper classes like Integer instead of int. 

The main difference is that arrays have a fixed length, while ArrayLists resize automatically. Arrays use the .length field, while ArrayLists use the .size() method. Arrays can store primitive types like int, but ArrayLists store objects like integer. Arrays are simpler and often more efficient for fixed data, while ArrayLists are more flexible for changing data.
